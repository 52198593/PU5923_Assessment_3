This document provides a description of the project planning and management processes applied to the work-based placement.

The first step was to establish a research question using the PECO (Population, Exposure, Comparator, Outcome) framework. A literature review was carried out, covering the main themes of antipsychotic use and impact on metabolism, specifically impact on blood glucose and weight gain, to establish the state of knowledge on risks of developing diabetes mellitus.

Following the literature review and after exploring the available datasets, I created a PERT chart to begin mapping out the process for designing a project, which can be seen in @fig-pert.

I learned that this is the 'ideal' version of how to plan a data analysis project; the reality was that I needed to return to the PECO and literature several times after spending time in the datasets and learning about the variables available in order to develop a better understand what I was trying to achieve. A more accurate process can be seen in @fig-pert2.

From this PERT chart I created a more detailed work plan to track progress and stay on task [@fig-gantt].

```{r}
# library(ganttrify) # Nice gantt charts with ggplot2
# library(readr) # reading csv files
# 
# project_timeline <- read_csv("../data/gantt_details.csv")
# 
# ganttrify(project_timeline,
#           project_start_date = "2023-05-15",
#           by_date = TRUE,
#           exact_date = TRUE,
#           alpha_wp = 0,
#           size_text_relative = 3,
#           axis_text_align = "left",
#           show_vertical_lines = FALSE,
#           font_family = "Roboto",
#           colour_palette = c("#758A0C", "#BC3F65", "#78BC3F", "#892E89"))
```

I also used Microsoft Lists to create task trackers with automated alerts to remind me of deadlines.

From this process I have developed a better sense of tasks and timelines required to complete this type of work.
